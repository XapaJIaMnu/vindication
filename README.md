vindication
===========

An extension to the Carneades framework, aiming to simulate a court case.

This project is based on the Haskell Carneades argumentation framework http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~bmv/CarneadesDSL/index.html
I developed it as part of a coursework and post it here with the permission of Bas van Gijzel.

To compile do a
cd src
sh build.sh

It produces a file called carneades

To run do a (of course after compiling first):
  
./carneades filename proposition_to_check
