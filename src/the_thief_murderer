--This represents a case that got famous recently in Bulgaria. It is about an
--ex policemen that is now a priest and a person who produces religious pictures
--of high quality (Iconograph, maybe, not sure what the word is in English). He
--shot a thief, a young 23 year old boy who was a repeated offender and a drug
--addict. Even though the priest had a revolver that he legally owned he shot
--with the hunting riffle that he used for birds and shot the thief in the legs
--in order to not fataly wound him or kill him. The thief however fled with the
--wound and didn't seek medical attention afraid of the police and died of bloodloss
--6 hours later. The pries was sentenced to 7 years in jail, because his life was not
--directly in danger as the thief had only a knife and had gone there to steal, not to
--kill and apparently what he should've done is give the thief all his possessions and
--not try to defend himself. This case aims to show that he should have been ruled
--innocent by any sensible court. His Name is Jordan Opitz, but unfortunately 
--Information about the case is not avaliable in English.
