Hans_Reiser - The Hans Reiser process, same as the first part, except the file was ported
to the format in order to display the court hearing. To run do:

./carneades Hans_Reiser murderer

the_thief_murderer - The thief murderer court case, slightly updated version compared to
part 1 of the assignment, shows a very good long dialogue with exchange of arguments and
counterarguments. To run do

./carneades the_thief_murderer intent

You could also run those in ghci. To do so do:
  
ghci Runme.hs

process_init "murderer" "Hans_Reiser"

or

process_init "intent" "the_thief_murderer"

More generic, unimpressive examples:

To run them do:
  
./carneades Hristo_Stoichkov simpleton

./carneades Test_part2 murder
