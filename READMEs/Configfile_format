Config file syntax:
Refer to one of the argument files for examples.

Basically you should place all your arguments between the ARGUMENTS: and ASSUMPTIONS: lines.
The arguments are in the form 
argument [proposition, proposition] [proposition, proposition] proposition weight.
Spaces and new lines are accepted everywhere. The restriction is that the propositions
in brackets should be separated by commas (",") and each argument should end with a point (".").
All other restrictions are as they are laid out in the assignment specifications.

Place your initial assumptions between ASSUMPTIONS: and STANDARDS: lines.
Optionaly put assumptions here to be taken into account initially before the dialogue between
the prosecution and the defence begins.
They should be in the format
[assumption, assumption, assumption]
and every assumptionshoudl obey the same rules that a proposition enclosed in bracket does.
Valid characters for propositions from the assignment specifications apply.

Place all your Standards after between STANDARDS: and the ADDITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS: line.
They should be in the format:
proposition standard
where standard could be one of the following.

scintilla
beyond_reasonable_doubt
preponderance
clear_and_convincing
dialectical_validity

If a proposition does not appear in this section of the document, it is assumed that it has scintilla
standard.

Place the rest of your assumptions after the ADDITIONAL ASSUMPTIONS: line.
Syntax is the same as for the Assumptions described above.
Those assumptions will gradually be taken one by one during the dialogue.

Comments are prefixed with -- and should be placed in the beginning of the line.
