To use the framework you need to do the following:
Place your config file in the directory of the haskell files.
Load the haskell files as follows:

ghci Runme.hs

To test for applicability do a:

testApp filename prop

Where filename is the name of your file and prop is the name of the proposition you want to test.
both filename and prop should strings (Which means they should be supplied in quotes ("")

To test proposition, see if it is True or False you should do a:

testProp filename prop

Where filename is the name of your file and prop is the name of the proposition you want to test.
both filename and prop should strings (Which means they should be supplied in quotes ("")

As always to check for negative proposition you should put a - in front of it ("-prop")

testProp "Hans_Reiser" "murderer" returns True

testProp "the_thief_murderer" "-intent" returns true

testProp "Hristo_Stoichkov" "simpleton" returns true
